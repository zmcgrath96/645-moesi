Completed by:

## Environment
We used python3 for this project. python2 may or may not work with this, so to be sure make sure you are using python3.

## Running
```
python3 main.py <path to trace 0> <path to trace 1> <path to trace 2> <path to trace 3>
```
Note: if you name all of the traces 'p#.tr' and put them in a directory named 'traces' then you can do 
```
python3 main.py -q
```
for a quicker way to run.
